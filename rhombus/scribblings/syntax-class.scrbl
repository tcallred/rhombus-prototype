@title[~tag: "syntax"]{Syntax Classes}

In a rhombus syntax form, pattern variables escaped with @rhombus[$] and surrounded by parentheses
can be annotated with a syntax class name using @rhombus[::] to specify the kind of
syntax the pattern variable can match on. Rhombus has several built-in syntax classes such as 
@rhombus[Term], @rhombus[Group], and @rhombus[Multi].

@(rhombusblock:
    val '$(x :: Term)': '1'
)

Rhombus also supports user-defined syntax classes that can annotate pattern 
variables in the same way. Custom syntax classes are useful for defining resusable patterns that can vary.
To define a syntax class, use the @rhombus[stx_class] special form with a block that 
contains the form @rhombus[patterns] followed by alternatives. 

@(rhombusblock:
    stx_class Arithmetic:
        patterns
        | '$x + $y'
        | '$x - $y'
)

Or, use a shorthand syntax that omits the use of @rhombus[patterns].

@(rhombusblock:
    stx_class Arithmetic
    | '$x + $y'
    | '$x - $y'
)

The patterns of a syntax class are defined with quasiquoted syntax objects (@rhombus[''])
and can include any literal syntax. Once defined, a custom syntax 
class can be used to annotate a pattern variable that will match on the shape 
of one of the specified pattern alternatives.

@(rhombusblock:
    expr.macro 'add_one_to_expr $(expr :: Arithmetic)':
        values('$expr ... + 1', '')
    
    add_one_to_expr 1 + 1 // expands to: 1 + 1 + 1
    add_one_to_expr 1 - 2 // expands to: 1 - 2 + 1
    add_one_to_expr 2 > 3 // error, "expected Arithmetic"
)

The @rhombus[$]-escaped variables in a syntax class's patterns will bind to matched syntax 
as attributes of the class. They can be accessed from a pattern variable using dot-notation. 

@(rhombusblock:
    expr.macro 'right_operand $(expr :: Arithmetic)':
        values(expr.y, '')
    
    right_operand 2 + 3 // expands to: 3
    right_operand 8 - 4 // expands to: 4
)

Attributes of a syntax class must appear in every pattern alternative in order to be
referred to with dot-notation.

@(rhombusblock:
    stx_class Arithmetic
    | '$x + $y + $z'
    | '$x - $y'

    val '$(expr: Arithmetic)': '1 + 2 + 3' // matches successfully
    expr.y // expands to: 2
    expr.z // error: attribute "z" not found
)

In other words, the attributes of a syntax class are defined by the intersection of all escaped pattern 
variables found in the pattern alternatives.
